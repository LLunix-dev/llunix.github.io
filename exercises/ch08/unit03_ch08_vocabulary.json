This time, I want to share my amazing trip to Peru \u2013 what an adventure!<\/p><p>First, I flew to Cusco, a city high in the mountains. At 3,500 metres, the altitude made me feel dizzy at first. After a day of rest, I was ready to explore \u2013 I was happy to <gap id=\"gap_16\"><\/gap> the busy city life. I decided to <gap id=\"gap_17\"><\/gap> a small tent and sleeping bag because my goal was to <gap id=\"gap_18\"><\/gap> nature. I joined a group of travellers, and together, we started hiking towards Machu Picchu. The hike was tough. We had to <gap id=\"gap_19\"><\/gap> steep* trails, <gap id=\"gap_20\"><\/gap> cold rivers, and walk for hours under the midday heat. But the views were incredible! We saw waterfalls, llamas, and deep valleys. It was late afternoon when we managed to <gap id=\"gap_21\"><\/gap> to a field. We decided to set up our camp there. It was peaceful, but it\u2019s not easy to <gap id=\"gap_22\"><\/gap> on the hard ground!<\/p><p>On my way to Machu Picchu, I <gap id=\"gap_23\"><\/gap> a friend of mine who started her hike two days before me. She was travelling with some interesting people from different countries. One of them, a guy from Canada, was there to <gap id=\"gap_24\"><\/gap> a photography project about Peruvian culture. He taught me how to take better pictures. After four days, we finally reached Machu Picchu. Standing there, looking at the ancient ruins, I felt proud. The journey was hard, but totally worth it. I even saw a condor flying high above the mountains! For the last part of my trip, I took a car to the Sacred Valley. I explored small villages, and I wanted to <gap id=\"gap_25\"><\/gap> local people who made beautiful hats and scarves by hand.<\/p><p>Now, I\u2019m back home, but I am ready to <gap id=\"gap_26\"><\/gap> another adventure.
