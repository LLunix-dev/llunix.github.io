For example, the first story, where a boy fell more than twelve metres from an upstairs window, then got up and walked away without getting hurt. This is how it happened.<\/p><p>The five-year-old boy got up early in the morning. He was walking around looking for his mother when he fell out of the window. His mother was still sleeping in her room but woke up when she heard her son screaming. She said, \u201cI looked outside and saw him lying on some rubbish bags*.\u201d A neighbour saw the boy fall and phoned the ambulance. She said, \u201cI was bird-watching out my window when I saw it happen. The ambulance arrived very quickly, but the boy was already up and walking when they arrived.\u201d The ambulance driver said, \u201cIt's incredible! The rubbish bags were lying there, ready to be picked up \u2013 an hour later. They saved the boy's life.\u201d<\/p><p><br><\/p><p><custom-image id=\"custom-image_1\"><\/custom-image>Another strange, but true story happened more than 40 years ago in Ohio, USA, where identical twins* were born. Their mother didn't have much money and no family to help her, so she put the two boys up for adoption*. They were adopted by different families just a few days after they were born.<\/p><p>The two families had no contact with each other. Each of the boys was called James. And this was just the first of a number of coincidences. When James and James finished school, they still didn't know each other. They were both good at drawing and working with wood, but they both became policemen. Each got married to a woman called Linda. Both had a son. One of them called their boy James Allen, and the other one called theirs \u2013 yes, that's right, James Allen! Both had a dog, and of course their dogs had the same name: Toy! When the two men met for the first time, it was 40 years after their adoption. They had an amazing story to share!<\/p><p><br><\/p><h4><b>VOCABULARY: *rubbish bag <\/b>\u2013 M\u00fcllsack; <b>identical twins<\/b> \u2013 eineiige Zwillinge; <b>put so. up for adoption<\/b> \u2013 jdn. zur Adoption freigeben<\/h4>","showOnStart":false,"configs":[{"id":"custom-image_0","type":"custom-image","url":"","name":"MO3_CH06_Read_rubbbish_dreamstimemedium_364240274_s.jpg","width":250,"margin":{"top":5,"right":0,"bottom":10,"left":5},"float":"right","style":""},{"id":"custom-image_1","type":"custom-image","url":"","name":"MO3_CH06_Reading_dreamstimemedium_36427939_s.jpg","width":250,"margin":{"top":10,"right":20,"bottom":0,"left":0},"float":"left","style":""}]},"sequences":[{"instruction":{"german":"<p>Read the text.
