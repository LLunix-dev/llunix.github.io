We went to the Lake District* in the northwest of England. There are high mountains and lots of lakes. We set off early one morning and travelled there by bus. It took us about six hours to get there. When we arrived at Lake Windermere, we had to carry all our gear* to our camp near the lake. Then we had to put up* our tents. That was quite difficult, and it took me and my friend Jamal quite a long time! After the tents were up, we had to make a fire for lunch. We are all city kids, so we didn't know how to do this. We had to do many things that were new for us. For example, we had to find out which plants were safe to eat, and we learned how to find our way in the hills by looking at a map instead of a GPS app. Fortunately, we had good weather on the trip. We went canoeing on the lake, and we learned to sail, too. We also had rock climbing lessons. I was afraid of doing that at first, because I'm afraid of heights*, but I got better at it, and I quite enjoyed it in the end.<\/p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\">But the best thing about the camp was making friends. I was friends with lots of people in my class, but getting to know people when you are sleeping in a small tent and helping each other climb up a dangerous rock face* is a different experience from just talking to each other in class.<\/p><p><em>Zach Melrose<\/em><\/p><p><br><\/p><h4><b>VOCABULARY: *district<\/b> \u2013 Region, Gebiet; <b>gear<\/b> \u2013 Ausr\u00fcstung; <b>put up<\/b> \u2013 aufstellen; <b>be afraid of heights<\/b> \u2013 unter H\u00f6henangst leiden; <b>rock face<\/b> \u2013 Felswand<\/h4>","showOnStart":false,"configs":[{"id":"custom-image_0","type":"custom-image","url":"","name":"MO3_CH09_Read_dreamstimemedium_91937406.jpg","width":310,"margin":{"top":5,"right":0,"bottom":0,"left":20},"float":"right","style":""}]},"sequences":[{"instruction":{"german":"<p>Read the text.
