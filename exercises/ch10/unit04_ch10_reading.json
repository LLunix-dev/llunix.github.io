They're going on a three-week trip to South America. Let's start with you Sam. What are you looking forward to on this trip?<\/p><p><b>Sam<\/b>\u21a0I'm looking forward to seeing the Amazon River! We're going on a four-day boat trip along the river. We're going to go canoeing and we'll be able to get close to alligators.<\/p><p><b>Mum<\/b>\u21a0Not too close, I hope!<\/p><p><b>Sam<\/b>\u21a0Don't worry, Mum. I said canoeing, not swimming! I'm looking forward to seeing other animals too. We might see some monkeys, snakes or giant frogs!<\/p><p><b>Interviewer<\/b>\u21a0What about you, Lina?<\/p><p><b>Lina<\/b>\u21a0I'm not that excited about the giant frogs, to be honest! And I don't like canoeing very much either. But I'm really interested in meeting kids of my age. I hope I'll have the chance on this trip. I still write to the friends I made on our last holiday in Norway \u2013 I like having friends who live in different countries.<\/p><p><b>Interviewer<\/b>\u21a0What about you, Mrs Hutchins? Is there anything else you're worried about apart from alligators?<\/p><p><b>Mum<\/b>\u21a0Oh yes! Lots of things. We're going up some high mountains in Peru and I'm a bit worried because I sometimes suffer from altitude sickness \u2026 and sleeping in a tent. But I'm looking forward to the scenery and trying some new food.<\/p><p><b>Dad<\/b>\u21a0Oh yes, I can't wait to try the local food too. I'm looking forward to seeing all the beautiful scenery around the Amazon River as well. But most of all, I just want to get away from it all. It'll be great to have the chance to be with each other for a few weeks and talk to each other. That's what I really want from this trip.<\/p>","showOnStart":false,"configs":[{"id":"custom-image_1","type":"custom-image","url":"","name":"MO3_CH10_Read_dreamstimemedium_247735828_s.jpg","width":350,"margin":{"top":0,"right":0,"bottom":0,"left":10},"float":"right","style":""}],"tableConfig":{"mode":"pixel","valueArray":["120",-1]}},"sequences":[{"instruction":{"german":null,"english":""},"configs":[{"question":"<p><b>What is Sam most looking forward to?<\/b><\/p>","correctAnswer":"<p>getting close to animals<\/p>","additionalAnswers":[{"answer":"<p>sleeping in a tent<\/p>"},{"answer":"<p>getting close to animals<\/p>"},{"answer":"<p>going up a high mountain<\/p>"},{"answer":"<p>meeting other kids<\/p>"}],"orientation":"vertical","id":"quiz_0","type":"quiz","exerciseUrl":"https:\/\/exercise-editor.helbling.com\/files\/MORE_3_2025\/more_3_2025_cyberhomework\/unit_04_CH_10\/unit_04_CH_10_reading\/"},{"question":"<p><b>How long will they be on a boat on the Amazon River?<\/b><\/p>","correctAnswer":"<p>four days<\/p>","additionalAnswers":[{"answer":"<p>three weeks<\/p>"},{"answer":"<p>a few weeks<\/p>"},{"answer":"<p>four days<\/p>"},{"answer":"<p>three days<\/p>"}],"orientation":"vertical","id":"quiz_1","type":"quiz","exerciseUrl":"https:\/\/exercise-editor.helbling.com\/files\/MORE_3_2025\/more_3_2025_cyberhomework\/unit_04_CH_10\/unit_04_CH_10_reading\/"}],"staticConfigs":[],"parts":["<p><quiz id=\"quiz_0\"><\/quiz><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><quiz id=\"quiz_1\"><\/quiz><\/p>"],"globalTypesConfigs":[{"type":"quiz","orientation":"vertical","itemPosition":"left","shuffle":false,"widthMode":"asLongestWord","width":-1}]},{"instruction":{"english":"","german":""},"parts":["<p><quiz id=\"quiz_2\"><\/quiz><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><quiz id=\"quiz_3\"><\/quiz><\/p>"],"configs":[{"question":"<p><b>What is Lina looking forward to?<\/b><\/p>","correctAnswer":"<p>making friends<\/p>","additionalAnswers":[{"answer":"<p>making friends<\/p>"},{"answer":"<p>seeing interesting animals<\/p>"},{"answer":"<p>canoeing in the Amazon<\/p>"},{"answer":"<p>writing to friends<\/p>"}],"orientation":"vertical","id":"quiz_2","type":"quiz","exerciseUrl":"https:\/\/exercise-editor.helbling.com\/files\/MORE_3_2025\/more_3_2025_cyberhomework\/unit_04_CH_10\/unit_04_CH_10_reading\/"},{"question":"<p><b>Who does Lina write to?<\/b><\/p>","correctAnswer":"<p>her friends in Norway<\/p>","additionalAnswers":[{"answer":"<p>her friends at home<\/p>"},{"answer":"<p>her friends in Peru<\/p>"},{"answer":"<p>her parents<\/p>"},{"answer":"<p>her friends in Norway<\/p>"}],"orientation":"vertical","id":"quiz_3","type":"quiz","exerciseUrl":"https:\/\/exercise-editor.helbling.com\/files\/MORE_3_2025\/more_3_2025_cyberhomework\/unit_04_CH_10\/unit_04_CH_10_reading\/"}],"staticConfigs":[],"globalTypesConfigs":[{"type":"quiz","orientation":"vertical","itemPosition":"left","shuffle":false,"widthMode":"asLongestWord","width":-1}]},{"instruction":{"english":"","german":""},"parts":["<p><quiz id=\"quiz_4\"><\/quiz><\/p><p><br><\/p><p><quiz id=\"quiz_5\"><\/quiz><\/p>"],"configs":[{"question":"<p><b>What is Mrs Hutchins NOT worried about?<\/b><\/p>","correctAnswer":"<p>eating different food<\/p>","additionalAnswers":[{"answer":"<p>eating different food<\/p>"},{"answer":"<p>getting too close to alligators<\/p>"},{"answer":"<p>suffering from altitude sickness<\/p>"},{"answer":"<p>sleeping in a tent<\/p>"}],"orientation":"vertical","id":"quiz_4","type":"quiz","exerciseUrl":"https:\/\/exercise-editor.helbling.com\/files\/MORE_3_2025\/more_3_2025_cyberhomework\/unit_04_CH_10\/unit_04_CH_10_reading\/"},{"question":"<p><b>What is Mr Hutchins MOST looking forward to?<\/b><\/p>","correctAnswer":"<p>getting away from it all<\/p>","additionalAnswers":[{"answer":"<p>trying new food<\/p>"},{"answer":"<p>getting away from it all<\/p>"},{"answer":"<p>looking at the scenery<\/p>"},{"answer":"<p>canoeing in the Amazon<\/p>"}],"orientation":"vertical","id":"quiz_5","type":"quiz","exerciseUrl":"https:\/\/exercise-editor.helbling.com\/files\/MORE_3_2025\/more_3_2025_cyberhomework\/unit_04_CH_10\/unit_04_CH_10_reading\/"}],"staticConfigs":[],"globalTypesConfigs":[{"type":"quiz","orientation":"vertical","itemPosition":"left","shuffle":false,"widthMode":"asLongestWord","width":-1}]}]}
