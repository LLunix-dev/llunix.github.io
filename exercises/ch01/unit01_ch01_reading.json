I went to a holiday camp in a forest near the beach. I've never been camping before, so I felt a bit nervous but I really enjoyed it! On the first day, we built a tree house. Ours was really high up in a tall tree! On the second day, we went rock climbing on a hill near the campsite. We had to wear helmets and safety belts. My friend's helmet fell off while he was climbing and he had to come down. On the third day, we visited a waterfall and we went swimming in a river. It was cold, but good fun. On the last day, we played football and tennis in a field in a beautiful valley. After that, we had a big picnic. We had some sandwiches and cheesecake, but we didn't have any ice cream. It was a fantastic trip! I might go again next year!<\/p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><em>Mark, France<\/em><\/p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><br><\/p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><custom-image id=\"custom-image_1\"><\/custom-image>I had a great summer! I went to a sports camp with my two brothers and their friends. I enjoyed it because I tried lots of new sports. We went mountain biking, roller-skating and windsurfing. Mountain biking was more fun than roller-skating, but it wasn't as good as windsurfing. My brothers liked windsurfing too, but my brothers' friends didn't like it because they kept falling into the sea! The sports camp has made me want to try more new sports. I might try some winter sports on my next holiday. I've already tried ice skating, but I've never been snowboarding or skiing! I'd love to try those one day!<\/p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><em>Tina, Greece<\/em><\/p>","configs":[{"id":"custom-image_0","type":"custom-image","url":"","name":"MO3_CH01_Read_boy_dreamstimemedium_315238096_s.jpg","width":150,"margin":{"top":10,"right":20,"bottom":0,"left":0},"float":"left","style":""},{"id":"custom-image_1","type":"custom-image","url":"","name":"MO3_CH01_Read_girl_dreamstimemedium_7079315_s.jpg","width":150,"margin":{"top":10,"right":20,"bottom":0,"left":0},"float":"left","style":""}],"showOnStart":false},"sequences":[{"instruction":{"german":"<p>Read the text.
